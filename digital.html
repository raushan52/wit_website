                                Online reputation is crucial and we at Wit Arist help you maintain that in a good way with your
clients. ORM or Online Reputation Management is a strategical method for advertising wherein
we check, create, monitor, and help with influencing your product or brand and your self-
publicity or credibility online. This is a very effective way and increases brand awareness and
provide new opportunities to our clients. This covers reputation of self or a person, a company,
product or services and is dependent also on what client does and how and what is being done
for promotion of product etc. or how much social networking is being used. Ideal online
reputation should be earned and cannot be achieved just by luck or accident. As rightly said it
takes many good work to create a fine reputation and only one bad one to lose it. All issues can
be resolved with feedback for better promotion too. With ORM you can use search tools and
have security enabled for your posts on social media, as search results have become part of life
of everyone.</p>
